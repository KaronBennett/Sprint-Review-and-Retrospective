# Sprint-Review-and-Retrospective
This is for my Software Development Lifecycle course.

How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

I interpret user needs by actively listening to the customer and translating those needs into product features. User stories help with this by clearly describing what the user wants from the product. 

How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I will approach developing programs with careful planning and breaking tasks down into smaller steps. I will also test my code frequently to avoid convoluted errors. Agile processes I will incorporate into my future development work are regular feedback loops and daily standups to assist in flexibility and improvements.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

To be a good team member, you must communicate openly with your team and collaborate to meet deadlines.
